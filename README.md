# pygame-wordle
wordle with graphics by pygame- v2 has win/lose sounds, key and grid colour changes for user feedback
pygme wordle with animation rise and fall win.py has the winning row animated and the border changes colour

Word list was distilled from a larger one freely available online I think from MIT. It definitly has some dodgy words in it but at 6k words I didn't look over them all so use at your own risk
