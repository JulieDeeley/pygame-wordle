# pygame-wordle
wordle with graphics by pygame- v2 has win/lose sounds, key and grid colour changes for user feedback 
Word list was distilled from a larger one freely available online I think from MIT. It definitly has some dodgy words in it but at 6k words I didn't look over them all so use at your own risk
